		<p id="synopsis">Each episode revolves around three characters: a yellow childlike humanoid with blue hair and overalls, an anthropomorphic green mallard duck with a tweed jacket, and a red humanoid with a mop-like head. They have no names explicitly stated within the series but are often referred to as Yellow Guy, Duck and Red Guy respectively. The characters only ever refer to each other with pronouns, never by name. Yellow Guy's father, Roy, also occasionally appears. An episode typically goes with the three main characters meeting one or several anthropomorphic characters, who begin a musical number related to a basic concept of day-to-day life with an upbeat melody, similar to that of a Sesame Street segment. As each song progresses, it becomes apparent that its moral or message is nonsensical and self-contradicting, and that the "teacher" character has ulterior sinister motives. The climax of each episode typically involves a plot twist involving the addition of escalating psychological horror, which then culminates into gore and graphic violence. Later in the series, the characters begin questioning the nature of their reality and the bizarre messages of the teachers.</p></td>

	<tr><td id="d"  class="bg-light"> Yellow Guy is shown with yellow skin and a round, orange nose, with short, blue spiky hair. He has a small, almost childlike body, with thin limbs and a wrinkly neck. He wears dark purplish blue overalls with a "D" stitched over the front pocket, and no shoes.
	<BR><br>
	He has a childlike personality and he enjoys the sight of nature. He is also very sensitive, which is shown when he becomes incredibly upset when Duck killed a butterfly. He doesn't seem to be smart when compared to his two friends, instead, he is someone goofy, clumsy, stubborn, and gaunt.</td>

		<td id="d"  class="bg-light">Red Guy is human-sized, and the tallest of the main trio. Unlike most characters, he is played by a person in a costume rather than a puppet. He has red, yarn-like hair that covers his entire head, with two eyes placed on top, and his whole body is red. At the end of episode 6, he appears to be blue entirely.
		<br><br>
		Out of all of his friends, he is the most mature, sarcastic, and sharp-witted. He also seems to have the most common sense as well. He is also the most pessimistic of the three main characters, as he doesn't show much interest in the lessons and would rather go about his own business.</td></tr>

	<tr><td id="d" class="bg-light">He is a dark green Mallard duck with a yellow beak and legs, wearing a brown blazer with a red handkerchief in one of his pockets. He owns a pair of glasses and a hat, although he is never seen wearing them.
	<br><br>
	Although Duck has proven to be the smart one among the protagonists, in the television series he is someone cynical, shameless, who believes that he is superior to others and, sometimes, is the first to insult his friends. Duck seems to be the only professional 'actor' as he is shown to over dramatize things and speak in a slightly exaggerated tone, as if reading from a script.</td></tr>
